			(Preface to the 15th year Italian edition of The Black Swan)<br><br>

I met Luca Formenton, Saggiatore’s capo twenty years ago, in April 2002, in the eternal city, in a mozzarella 
<span class="tooltip">
	bar-terrace
	<span class="tooltiptext">
		<img src="./pic/howiwrite/bar-terrace.jpg" alt="bar-terrace" class="expic">
	</span>
</span> 
near the 
<span class="tooltip">
	parliament
	<span class="tooltiptext">
		<img src="./pic/howiwrite/parliament.jpg" alt="parliament" class="expic">
	</span>
</span>. I spoke in highly ungrammatical Italian; he addressed me in impeccable 
 English, a practice we have sort of maintained for twenty years. That was the period when I very badly wanted
 to satisfy my failed childhood dream to produce literature, but everything conspired to stop me from 
 <span class="tooltip">
	partaking
	<span class="tooltiptext1">
		To eat or drink something especially something that is offered to you.
	</span>
</span> 
 
 of that highly protected genus.<br><br>

I was in Rome supposedly for a conference on risk but I just wanted an excuse to be in Italy (coincidentally I
 also made friends with Daniel Kahneman on the same day, another, more complicated story). Luca was the first 
 literary editor who was interested in my work, thanks to an 
<span class="tooltip">
	intercession
	<span class="tooltiptext1">
		speaking to somebody in order to persuade them to be kind to somebody else.
	</span>
</span> 
  by the late Marco Di Martino.<br><br>

By then I had written the first volume of the Incerto, Fooled by Randomness, a book that was practically impossible
 to publish. It was a continental style meditative essay and the Anglo Saxon world, in spite of their 
<span class="tooltip">
	infatuation
	<span class="tooltiptext1">
		very strong feelings of attraction for sb, especially when these are unreasonable and do not last long.
	</span>
</span>  
 with Montaigne and Umberto Eco, were about five hundred years late to the
<span class="tooltip">
	genre
	<span class="tooltiptext1">
		a particular type or style of literature that you can recognize because of its special features.
	</span>
</span> 
 . The official “subject” (an essay
 is not supposed to have such a 
<span class="tooltip">
	constraint 
	<span class="tooltiptext">
		<img src="./pic/howiwrite/constraint.jpg" alt="constraint" class="expic">
	</span>
</span>
 as a subject) was a random mixture of autobiography, philosophy (of probability)
 , mathematics, inductive logic, 
<span class="tooltip">
	 musings
	<span class="tooltiptext">
		<img src="./pic/howiwrite/musing.jpg" alt="musing" class="expic">
	</span>
</span>
 on historical events and financial markets. It included 
<span class="tooltip">
	parables
	<span class="tooltiptext1">
		a short story that teaches a moral lesson, especially one of those told by Jesus as recorded in the Bible.
	</span>
</span>
  with fictional characters, one of whom seemed to resemble me, which appeared to be confusing since I also had 
  explicit autobiographical episodes. “Why are you confusing the reader with both Nero Tulip and yourself”, 
  I was often asked by those who did not find the mixture too 
<span class="tooltip">
	uncanny
	<span class="tooltiptext1">
		strange and difficult to explain.
	</span>
</span>
   and continued reading the text. “What’s wrong with confusing the reader?” was my usual answer. The good thing
   about inserting “randomness” in the title is that it allowed me to write about anything that crossed my mind, 
   given the 
<span class="tooltip">
	ubiquity
	<span class="tooltiptext1">
		the fact that something seems to be everywhere or in several places at the same time.
	</span>
</span>   
   of chance and, worse, the lack of awareness of it. Not unexpectedly, the reaction of publishing
   houses had been unanimously dismissive: why would anyone mix finance, Solon, and Proust? And why these mathematical
   discussions?<br><br>

Now I have no problem with focus and precision: I do not want my vacuum cleaner user manual to be a stream of 
consciousness. I had written a specialized treatise in mathematical finance, and was embarking on a career writing
 scientific papers, which must be as narrow as possible. But literature should not have explicit boundaries: the 
 confines of the subject are internal and may remain 
<span class="tooltip">
	elusive
	<span class="tooltiptext1">
		difficult to find, define or achieve.
	</span>
</span> 
  and hard to express in words. Nor should literature 
 have institutions formalizing and commoditizing things. And I wanted to do my own version of what is called literature
 . Literature must be  
<span class="tooltip">
	idiosyncratic
	<span class="tooltiptext1">
		unusual and particular to a person or thing.
	</span>
</span>. I remained 

<span class="tooltip">
	undeterred
	<span class="tooltiptext1">
		if somebody is undeterred by something, they do not allow it to stop them from doing something.
	</span>
</span>
 by the insults in the rejection letters. Something I experienced even more acutely with The Black Swan, editors were 
 not content in rejecting the book as a wise businessperson would reject an investment, by saying something like it may
 be great but I do not wish to take the gamble or politely appeal to caution. No; they went out of their way to explain
 with a lot of precision why it would 
<span class="tooltip">
	flop
	<span class="tooltiptext1">
		to be a complete failure.
	</span>
</span>
, why nobody would read it. Both Fooled by Randomness and its successor The 
 Black Swan were treated by the industry like Yevgenia Krasnova’s Story of 
<span class="tooltip">
	Recursion
	<span class="tooltiptext1">
		the process of repeating a function, each time applying it to the result of the previous stage.
	</span>
</span>
 (which few realize was about The 
 Black Swan recursively talking about itself and its own future). All books acquire retrospective qualities after they
 become successful.<br><br>

My belief has always been that primo, “books are not written for book editors” and secundo, almost all book editors 
don’t know it –it turns out that there are good editors in some elite houses (such as Will Murphy in New York, Will 
Goodlad in London, and those who replaced them) but these were still outside my reach then. Predictably, I refused 
to be edited, feeling that it disrupts the inner harmony of the text; the 
<span class="tooltip">
	manuscript
	<span class="tooltiptext">
		<img src="./pic/howiwrite/manuscript.jpg" alt="manuscript" class="expic">
	</span>
</span>
manuscript showed a fiercely stubborn 
personality, which editors easily confirmed upon meeting its author.<br><br>

Finally, I 
<span class="tooltip">
	miraculously
	<span class="tooltiptext1">
		in a way that is completely unexpected and very lucky; as if by a miracle.
	</span>
</span>
 managed to get temporarily published by a newly founded aggressive internet house who
 traded my refusal to be edited against lower royalties. The house was so 
<span class="tooltip">
	patently
	<span class="tooltiptext1">
		without doubt.
	</span>
</span>
  incompetent (yet aggressive)
 that they rapidly became financially
<span class="tooltip">
	insolvent
	<span class="tooltiptext1">
		not having enough money to pay what you owe.
	</span>
</span>
  –the managers burned their cash on first class transatlantic 
 seats and lavish author parties (not mine). But I had no reason to complain: only an incompetent-but-aggressive
 publishing house would have accepted to publish me. To cheat, Fooled by Randomness had been promoted to some as 
 a business book (although the only business in it is its dismissal of business as both a vulgar and a random thing)
 ; to others as a philosophy of science manual though the demand for these was so limited that the last books in 
 that category that were read beyond a narrow group of graduate students were by Karl Popper, fifty years earlier.<br><br>

However, by the time I met Luca, Fooled by Randomness had been steadily circulating via word-of-mouth, thanks to the internet. Your local bookstore, in spite of the romanticism for the neighborhood business, is only interested in local turnover for what can be rigidly categorized, say the biography of an exiting president or the travelogue of a recently divorced suburban dentist’s trip to Tuscany. But a revolution happened around then. Amazon, the internet publisher, could now reach people across genres and connect authors to my kind of readers who may be locally rare but large enough across the planet. For the internet switched the focus from physical geography to thematic subjects –the shift was analog to the replacement of the Riemann integral with a Lebesgue one. This is what put me on the map and in the presence of Luca Formenton on that spring day in Rome.<br><br>

It was Luca who firmed up a certain idea in my head. He said that Saggiatore, his publishing house, had for its
 best success the Italian translation of Triste Tropiques by Claude Levi-Strauss, which put a quarter million 
 books in the hands of readers. Except that it was five thousand a year over (almost) fifty years. It evoked 
 the joke about winning a million zlotys at the Polish lottery: you receive 1 zloty a year for one million years
 –but joking apart, here is the very idea of robustness: the expression 
<span class="tooltip">
	chi va piano va sano –e va lontano
	<span class="tooltiptext1">
		Who goes slow and steady wins.
	</span>
</span>
 is double edged. 
<span class="tooltip">
	Lontano
	<span class="tooltiptext1">
		Italian for distant or away.
	</span>
</span>
  in Italian is both 
<span class="tooltip">
	temporal
	<span class="tooltiptext1">
		connected with or limited by time.
	</span>
</span>
  and 
<span class="tooltip">
	spatial
	<span class="tooltiptext1">
		relating to space and the position, size, shape, etc. of things in it.
	</span>
</span>
  .<br><br>

Luca seemed to know it was my kind of book. The hidden story, of which I became aware when I started writing the
 Incerto, is that Triste Tropiques was written initially as a novel. What’s more, he started with the poetic, 
 Baudelairian title (
<span class="tooltip">
	reminiscent
	<span class="tooltiptext1">
		reminiscent of somebody/something: reminding you of somebody/something
	</span>
</span> 
  of Tristesse de la lune), then embarked on the writing of the stuff. 
<span class="tooltip">
	Anthropology
	<span class="tooltiptext1">
		the study of the human race, especially of its origins, development, customs and beliefs.
	</span>
</span>
 , Brazil, the Amazon were some background topic. I realized that I was playing Levi-Strauss’s game: find some topic
 to furnish one’s autobiographically driven reflections. As I wrote earlier, genuine literature is not found in the
 Goncourt circles or among these salon people who go to parties and readings in New York and tag themselves with a
 “literary” label by deploying a certain vocabulary and mentioning Borges. No, as I said, literature was something
 fundamentally grounded in its creator, the individual.<br><br>

But there is something more central to the story: this idea of surviving fifty years without anybody noticing is a great lesson on what came to be called in The Black Swan the Lindy effect.<br><br>

How do I write? The common fallacy is that if you want people to read you in the future, you must project something
 related to the future, focused on the contemporary and be as different from the past as possible –say by populating
 your work with space machines, high technology, and revolutionary ideas. My U.S. publisher still tries to squeeze 
 modern art on the cover when I am looking elsewhere.<br><br>

No, no; it’s the exact opposite. I stood the idea on its head. If you want to be read in the future, make sure you
 would have been read in the past. We have no idea of what’s in the future, but we have some knowledge of what was
 in the past. So I make sure I would have been read both in the past and in the present time, that is by both the
 comtemporaries and the dead. So I speculated that books that would have been 
<span class="tooltip">
	relevant
	<span class="tooltiptext1">
		the fact of being valuable and useful to people in their lives and work.
	</span>
</span> 
  twenty years in the past (conditional of course of being relevant today) would be interesting twenty years in the future.<br><br>

Another discovery I made then, and to which I have been adhering until the present. If you consider writing a creative
 endeavor, then avoid practicing it in 
<span class="tooltip">
	mundane
	<span class="tooltiptext1">
		not interesting or exciting.
	</span>
</span>
  matters as it may both dull your vitality and make it feel like drudgery,
 work. I find it painful to write outside of my books (or mathematical papers) –and immensely pleasurable to write in 
 book form. So I limit my emails to one or two 
<span class="tooltip">
	laconic
	<span class="tooltiptext1">
		using only a few words to say something.
	</span>
</span>
  (but sometimes incomprehensible) sentences, postcard like; the 
 same with social media posts that are not
<span class="tooltip">
	exceprts
	<span class="tooltiptext1">
		a short extract from a film, broadcast, or piece of music or writing.
	</span>
</span> 
  from books. There is still such a 
<span class="tooltip">
	contraption
	<span class="tooltiptext1">
		a machine or piece of equipment that looks strange or complicated and possibly does not work well.
	</span>
</span>
  called a telephone. 
 Likewise, I don’t read letters and emails longer than a postcard. Writing must have some solemnity. Reading and writing,
 in the past, were the province of the sacred.<br><br>


Twenty Years Later: I was passing through Milan in the summer of 2022, and Luca wanted to meet. I suspected that, 
principally, he wanted to show me his 
<span class="tooltip">
	 gravel bicycle
	<span class="tooltiptext">
		<img src="./pic/howiwrite/gravelbicycle.jpg" alt="gravelbicyle" class="expic">
	</span>
</span>
. But he also had a gift for me: a special, about fifty year 
old edition of Tristi Tropici. Inside the book was a photocopy of some accounting report. He said that the Cigno 
nero published fifteen years earlier became his new Tristi Tropici.<br>
